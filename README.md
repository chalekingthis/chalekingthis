### 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a passionate and curious individual currently enrolled in the **ALX Software Engineering Program**, focusing on **Frontend Web Development**.

I started this journey because I believe **technology is the most powerful tool of our time to unlock human potential and solve real-world problems**. Coming from a background in Political Science and International Development, I was drawn to software engineering as a way to apply my creativity and critical thinking toward **building inclusive digital solutions** that serve people and communities.

🌱 **What Inspires Me:**  
I am inspired by how **code can connect, educate, and empower people**, and I want to contribute to a world where access to technology and information is not a privilege but a basic right.

🎯 **My Vision:**  
To **build and lead digital solutions that drive inclusive development, empower young people through education, and improve lives across Africa using technology.**

💼 I’m excited to work on:
- **User-focused web applications** that solve everyday challenges
- **EdTech and civic tech platforms**
- **Open source projects** that give back to the community
- **Collaborative frontend projects** using React, JavaScript, and responsive design principles
